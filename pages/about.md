# What is SoGive?

SoGive is a tool that lets you see the impact you’ve made in the world through all your charitable giving. We aim to show you the impact of your donation - i.e. what did your giving achieve, not just how much money did you give.

	<tr><td>£100 to Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</td><td>200 children dewormed, and an extra year of education for 10 children</td></tr>
	<tr><td>£200 to Project Healthy Children</td><td>4000 people with stronger nutrition thanks to supplementation of staple foods</td></tr>
	<tr><td>£500 to Make a Wish Foundation</td><td>Your donation, together with another eleven of the same size, allowed one child with a life-threatening illness to have their wish come true</td></tr>

The SoGive platform is a social media enabled platform -- you can link to facebook and twitter and let your friends know about the good you achieve in the world. We believe in being open and proud about your achievements with charitable giving - we don’t want you to hide your light under a bushel! But if you prefer to stay quiet about charity activity, it's your choice.

We don't plan to force people to pay a fee to use SoGive, however we will suggest that a percentage of each donation goes to SoGive so that we can continue to provide the service.

SoGive is a not-for-profit social enterprise. If any profit did arise, the founders have both pledged to give all the profit away to charity.
